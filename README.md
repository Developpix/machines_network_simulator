A project to create a simulator of machine's network.
==============================================================================================

A short description of the project.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is machine's object which contains some network's card.
An network can be a bluetooth network, a wireless network or a cable network.
Every network's card can be connected to one network, but the type of the network which can be
connected to the network's card depend of the type of the network's card.

### There is three type of network's card :
* A bluetooth network's card which can be connected to a bluetooth network,
* A wireless network's card which can be connected to a wireless network,
* A ethernet network's card which can be connected to a cable network.

The maximum number of network's card per network depend of the network's type.

### There is three type of network :
* A wireless network which can contains an unlimited number of network's cards,
* A bluetooth network which can contains two bluetooth network's cards,
* A cable network which can contains two network's cards.
